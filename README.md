# EPFL Dojo website
A static website for informations about EPFL dojos. Available here: <https://epfl-dojo.github.io/>.

## Development
First you have to understand what is Jekyll and how it works. A simple `git clone ...`
wouldn't be enough to run the site locally. You have to setup [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) first.

* install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) (e.g. `sudo apt install jekyll`, `bundle install`)
* checkout the repository
* run (`jekyll serve`)
* go to the listed URL (e.g. http://localhost:4000)
